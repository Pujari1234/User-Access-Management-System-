# Project Overview

This project is a User Access Management system built with Node.js, React, and TypeORM. It consists of a backend API for managing user authentication and authorization, as well as a frontend application for user interaction.

## Features

- User registration and login functionality
- Role-based access control
- JWT-based authentication
- User management (CRUD operations)
- Input validation and error handling

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - TypeORM
  - PostgreSQL (or any other supported database)
  - JWT for authentication
  - TypeScript

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Context API for state management

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: `backend` and `frontend`.

### Backend

- **src/config**: Contains configuration files for database and JWT.
- **src/controllers**: Contains controller classes for handling requests related to authentication and user management.
- **src/entities**: Contains entity definitions for the database.
- **src/middleware**: Contains middleware functions for authentication and validation.
- **src/routes**: Contains route definitions for the API.
- **src/services**: Contains service classes for business logic.
- **src/types**: Contains TypeScript types and interfaces.
- **src/utils**: Contains utility functions.
- **src/app.ts**: Entry point for the backend application.

### Frontend

- **src/components**: Contains React components for authentication and user management.
- **src/context**: Contains context for managing authentication state.
- **src/services**: Contains service functions for making API requests.
- **src/types**: Contains TypeScript types and interfaces.
- **src/App.tsx**: Entry point for the frontend application.
